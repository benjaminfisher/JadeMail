JadeMail
========

HTML Email creation tool built on top of the [http://expressjs.com/](Express.js) web server using [http://livejs.com/](Live.js) and Jade templating

You will obviously need Node.js to use this tool. Jade is a dependancy of Express, so you don't need to install that seperately.

The basic template with a wrapping table set to width 100% and a centered content table with a width of 600 is contained in layout.jade
Put your content in index.jade.

After you are done with development, just save the html file from the browser as your email file.
